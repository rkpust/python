 Python Comments
 ------------------
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Creating a Comment
-----------------------
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from 
executing code:

Example:
comments.py

Multiline Comments
----------------------------
Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline 
string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

Example:
comments.py


As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
