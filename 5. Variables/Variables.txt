Variables
------------------------
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Creating Variables
----------------------------
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Example: variables.py

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have
been set.

Example: variables.py


Casting
------------------------
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example: variables.py


Get the Type
-------------------
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
